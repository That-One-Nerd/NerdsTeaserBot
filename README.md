# Nerd's Teaser Bot

Nerd's Teaser Bot is a bot I made to run my server mainly, but as I developed it more and more, I realized I could release it to the public just fine. So, here you go!
This is being posted to the internet not so much to allow others to fork it, but more to look at the code. If you want the bot, you can invite it yourself.
